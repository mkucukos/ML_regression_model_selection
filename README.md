# ML_Polynomial-Regression_model

This script displays the results of a Polynomial Regression_model applied to data that includes position level and salary information.
I trained the model on the entire dataset because we only have a little amount of data. On the same data set, the performance of the linear and polynomial regression models were evaluated, and the polynomial regression model was shown to be more robust. Finally, I plotted the regression model Â in higher resolution.
