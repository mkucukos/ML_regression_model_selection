# ML_regression_model_selection

This script shows the results of various regression models that were used to predict energy output using variables such as engine temperature, exhaust vacuum, pressure, and relative humidity. The data was divided into two sets: training and testing, with feature scaling (SVR) applied to both sets. The best model for estimating energy output was found to be Random Forest Regression.
